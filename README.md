# Project-Set-the-Scene

Our project as a whole is a desktop background management system that allows users to upload custom images for background use. These uploaded images are then able to be tagged with a set series of qualities set by the development team, one of the first challenges faced by the development group. From here the system also faces the issue of immersiveness, as the end goal is to have a system that is able to utilize the user’s local time, date, and weather data to set up a personalized experience and array of backgrounds over the course of the desktop’s use. Key terms will include tags, which are the qualities prescribed to certain photos, as well as weights, the priority each tag will hold. The purpose is to create an environment on the desktop that matches with our surroundings. So often we feel isolated from the outside world when we are working on our individual devices, a customizable background allows the user to feel more comfortable and connected even while working from their desk. It's a certain level of freedom and creativity that is often not present for desktop users with any level of notable versatility.
